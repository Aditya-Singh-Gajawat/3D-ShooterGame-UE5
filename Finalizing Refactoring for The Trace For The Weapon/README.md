The code provided defines a character class (`AMyCharacter`) with various functionality related to movement, abilities, and interactions within the game. Within this class, several functions implement the **early return** pattern, which is a programming technique used to exit a function early if certain conditions aren't met, preventing unnecessary computation and potential errors. Here's an explanation of how early returns are utilized in the code:

### 1. **`AMyCharacter::SpawnFX()`**
In the `SpawnFX` function, an early return is used at the beginning to check if the `GetWorld()` function call returns a valid world context:
```cpp
if (!GetWorld()) 
{
    return;
}
```
If the world context is invalid (i.e., `GetWorld()` is `nullptr`), the function exits immediately, preventing further operations such as spawning particle effects. This ensures that no further logic is executed when the game world context is not available, avoiding potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

### 2. **`AMyCharacter::GetBeamEndPointLocation()`**
Within the `GetBeamEndPointLocation` function, early returns are used to handle invalid engine or viewport contexts:
```cpp
if (!GEngine && !GEngine->GameViewport)
{
    return false; // Early return if GEngine or GameViewport is invalid
}
```
If either `GEngine` or `GameViewport` is invalid (`nullptr`), the function returns `false` immediately, bypassing further calculations that rely on these engine components. This prevents potential issues that would arise from trying to access invalid pointers or objects.

Additionally, the function checks whether the screen-to-world conversion was successful:
```cpp
if (!bScreenToWorld) 
{
    return false;
}
```
If the conversion fails (`bScreenToWorld` is `false`), the function returns `false` right away, ensuring that the subsequent logic does not attempt to perform unnecessary tracing or calculations based on invalid data.

### Benefits of Early Returns in this Code:
- **Prevents unnecessary computation**: By returning early when certain conditions arenâ€™t met (such as an invalid world context or unsuccessful screen-to-world conversion), the code avoids executing the remaining logic that relies on those conditions being true.
- **Improves code clarity**: Early returns make the logic easier to follow because they handle failure cases upfront, rather than nesting the rest of the function inside multiple condition checks.
- **Error prevention**: Returning early prevents operations that could lead to errors or undefined behavior, such as attempting to spawn particles or perform line traces without the necessary game context.

In summary, the code employs the early return pattern to handle invalid or undesirable conditions right away, improving efficiency, reducing unnecessary computation, and safeguarding against potential runtime errors.
