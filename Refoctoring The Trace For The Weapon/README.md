### Refactoring of Trace Functions: Key Differences and Improvements

#### Original (Commented-out) Trace Code

In the original, commented-out code, the trace functionality was embedded directly within the `SpawnFX` function. Here's how the original flow worked:

1. **Crosshair Trace**:
   - The code deprojects the screen space (crosshair position) into world space.
   - It then traces a line from the crosshair's world position to a point far in front of the player (`50000.f` units away).
   - If the trace hits an object (`ScreenHitResult.bBlockingHit`), the hit location is stored as the new endpoint (`BeamEndPoint`).

2. **Weapon Barrel Trace**:
   - The code retrieves the socket transform (position) for the weapon's barrel from the character's mesh socket.
   - A second trace is performed from the barrel position to the previously determined `BeamEndPoint` (either the default or the one hit by the crosshair trace).
   - If the trace from the barrel hits an object, the `BeamEndPoint` is updated to the new hit location.

3. **Spawning FX**:
   - If the trace hits, it spawns hit effect particles at the `BeamEndPoint`.
   - It also spawns a particle beam that connects the weapon to the hit location.

This approach is functional but has a few drawbacks:
- The trace logic is directly embedded within the effect-spawning function, making the code longer and harder to maintain.
- The same trace logic (crosshair trace and barrel trace) is used every time we want to spawn effects, which introduces redundancy.
- The logic is not reusable for other cases where traces might be needed.

#### Refactored Trace Code

The refactor separates the trace logic from the effect-spawning logic, creating a **dedicated trace function** (`GetBeamEndPointLocation`) to handle the tracing. Here's how the refactored code works:

1. **`GetBeamEndPointLocation`**:
   - This function encapsulates all the trace logic:
     1. **Crosshair Trace**:
        - The crosshair is deprojected into world space, and a line trace is performed from the crosshair's world position, just like before.
        - If the trace hits, the `BeamEndLocation` is updated to the hit location.
     2. **Weapon Barrel Trace**:
        - A trace is performed from the weapon barrel to the previously determined `BeamEndLocation` (similar to the original).
        - If the barrel trace hits, the `BeamEndLocation` is updated again.
   - The function returns a `bool` indicating whether the trace was successful. If the function returns `true`, the location of the trace hits will be available in the `BeamEndLocation` variable.

2. **`SpawnFX`**:
   - This function now **delegates the tracing to `GetBeamEndPointLocation`**:
     - The function calls `GetBeamEndPointLocation` to calculate the final endpoint for the beam (i.e., where to spawn effects).
     - If `GetBeamEndPointLocation` returns `true` (i.e., the trace was successful), the function proceeds to spawn the hit effect particles at the `BeamEndPoint`.
     - A particle beam is spawned from the weapon to the `BeamEndPoint`, just like before.

### Key Differences Between Original and Refactored Trace Logic

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - **Original**: Trace logic and effect spawning were mixed together inside `SpawnFX`.
   - **Refactored**: Trace logic has been moved into its own function (`GetBeamEndPointLocation`). `SpawnFX` now only handles spawning effects, while `GetBeamEndPointLocation` focuses solely on trace calculations.

2. **Code Reusability**:
   - **Original**: Every time you wanted to spawn effects, the trace logic was duplicated inside the `SpawnFX` function.
   - **Refactored**: The trace logic is now reusable. You can call `GetBeamEndPointLocation` anywhere you need to calculate the beam's endpoint without duplicating the trace logic. This makes the code cleaner and more maintainable.

3. **Clarity and Maintainability**:
   - **Original**: The trace and effect spawning were intertwined, making it harder to understand and maintain the code. Any change to the trace logic would have to be done directly within `SpawnFX`.
   - **Refactored**: The refactoring makes the code easier to read and maintain. The trace logic is now self-contained and easy to modify without affecting the effect spawning logic. This reduces cognitive load when maintaining the code.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - **Original**: There was no direct check for whether the trace was successful in a separate function. It was checked in an inline manner within the `SpawnFX` function.
   - **Refactored**: The trace success is more explicit. The `GetBeamEndPointLocation` function returns a boolean (`true` or `false`), making it clear whether the trace was successful. This is a cleaner, more robust approach.

### Summary of the Refactor's Benefits

- **Modularity**: Trace logic is isolated in a separate function (`GetBeamEndPointLocation`), which improves modularity.
- **Maintainability**: The refactor reduces code duplication and makes the codebase more maintainable by centralizing trace functionality.
- **Clarity**: The code is clearer, as the trace logic is decoupled from effect spawning. Each function has a specific responsibility.
- **Reusability**: The trace logic is now reusable, so it can be used for other purposes (e.g., detecting hits in other parts of the game) without duplication.

By refactoring the trace functions in this way, the code is more efficient and easier to work with, particularly for future updates or changes to the trace behavior.
